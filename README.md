# A template for creating a Python package

This is my template for creating new Python packages. It uses
[cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) to create a
skeleton of a Python package, so that I don't have to copy and paste a bunch
of files when starting a new package.

## Prerequisites
If you want to use this template, first you'll need to install cookiecutter
with conda:

``` sh
conda install -c conda-forge cookiecutter
```

or pip:

``` sh
pip install cookiecutter
```


## Usage
To create a new Python package it run:
``` sh
cookiecutter gh:wfondrie/cookiecutter-python-package
```
